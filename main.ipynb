A Jupyter Notebook is a file that combines executable programming code with visualizations and comments in markdown format, allowing for an intuitive documentation of the code. We use Jupyter Notebooks for combined coding and documentation. We use Python 3 as programming language. All Notebooks are stored on [GitHub](https://github.com/), a platform for software development, and are publicly available. More information on our IT-concept can be found [here](http://open-power-system-data.org/it). See also our [step-by-step manual](http://open-power-system-data.org/step-by-step) how to use the dataplatform."

    "CoSSMic stands for **Co**llaborating **S**mart **S**olar-powered **Mic**rogrids. The consortium addressed the coupling of solar panels with smart energy sharing solutions and storage capabilities, while researching a decentralized, agent-based model approach, to optimize the potentials to exchange energy inside small communities. The complete [CoSSMic Mission Statement](http://cossmic.eu/mission-statement/) may provide further insight.\n",

It includes data of small businesses, as well as private households, in a resolution up to single device consumptions.\n",

Emoncms is a powerful open-source web-app for processing, logging and visualising energy, temperature and other environmental data and was used as a mediator between all drivers and services.
